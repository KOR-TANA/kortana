## 🎯 The 7 Tasks (Quick Reference)

### **1. Backend Heartbeat** (Priority: CRITICAL)
- Create FastAPI backend with `/api/health` endpoint
- Mount routers for gemini, memory, agents
- Wire to frontend apiService.ts
- **Start time**: Now
- **Est. time**: 2 hours

### **2. Cloud Run CI/CD** (Priority: CRITICAL)  
- GitHub Actions workflow for Docker build + push to Artifact Registry
- OIDC authentication (no secrets in repo)
- Auto-deploy to Cloud Run on main branch push
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Est. time**: 3 hours

### **3. Task Queue + Auto-Branching** (Priority: HIGH)
- Read tasks from COVENANT_INDEX.md
- Auto-create feature/* branches via GitHub API
- Push stub commits for each task
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Est. time**: 4 hours

### **4. Daily Autonomy Logs** (Priority: HIGH)
- DailySyncCard.tsx component
- Daily cron workflow posts status to logs/daily/
- Updates COVENANT_INDEX.md with sync timestamp
- **Depends on**: Task 1
- **Est. time**: 2 hours

### **5. VS Code Extension** (Priority: MEDIUM)
- WebView panels for AI Studio + Cloud Run deploy page
- Command to auto-unseal runtime with Puppeteer
- "Kor'tana" sidebar in VS Code
- **Depends on**: Task 1, 2
- **Est. time**: 3 hours

### **6. GitHub Issue Analysis** (Priority: HIGH)
- Frontend sends issue/PR to backend via `/api/github/analyze`
- Backend forwards to Gemini for analysis
- Returns summary, priority, suggested actions
- **Depends on**: Task 1, 2
- **Est. time**: 2 hours

### **7. Autonomy Audit Trail** (Priority: HIGH)
- AutonomyAudit.tsx component (timeline of all autonomous actions)
- Logging service that writes to logs/autonomy/*.md
- 24h heartbeat check workflow (alerts if no new logs)
- **Depends on**: Task 3, 4, 6
- **Est. time**: 3 hours

## 🔄 Workflow: From Task → Merged PR

```
1. Create GitHub Issue (from GITHUB_ISSUES.md)
2. Paste into Copilot chat (from AUTONOMOUS_TASKS.md)
3. Copilot generates code
4. Review → Create feature branch
5. Commit: git commit -m "feat: issue #XX - {description}"
6. Push: git push origin feature/task-XX
7. Create PR (link to issue)
8. Merge when ready
9. Close issue → Checkbox ✅ in COVENANT_INDEX.md
```
